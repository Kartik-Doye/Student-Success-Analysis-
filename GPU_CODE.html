    <h1>Understanding GPU Cores with a Development Team Analogy</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Step 1: CPU vs GPU</h2>
      <p><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong> = Project Manager (PM). The PM is smart and can handle many different tasks, but usually works on them one at a time.</p>
      <p><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</strong> = Whole Development Team. A GPU has many workers (cores) that can all do tasks in parallel, finishing faster when the job can be split.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Step 2: Different GPU Cores = Different Roles in a Team</h2>

      <h3>1. CUDA Cores â€” The Developers</h3>
      <p><strong>Development Team Analogy:</strong> These are the programmers writing and testing code. They handle most of the work that can be broken into many small tasks.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>Many developers coding different parts of a website at the same time.</li>
          <li>Fixing multiple simple bugs in parallel.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p><strong>GPU Real Example:</strong> CUDA cores calculate millions of pixels for games, process videos, or simulate weather models all at once.</p>

      <h3>2. Tensor Cores â€” The AI Specialists</h3>
      <p><strong>Development Team Analogy:</strong> These are the data scientists or AI engineers. They focus on analyzing data and building models.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>Training a chatbot to answer questions.</li>
          <li>Creating an AI tool that automatically suggests code.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p><strong>GPU Real Example:</strong> Tensor cores speed up AI tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and DLSS (AI upscaling in games).</p>

      <h3>3. RT Cores â€” The Testers and Designers</h3>
      <p><strong>Development Team Analogy:</strong> These are the testers and UX designers who focus on making the product look and feel real and correct.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <ul>
          <li>Testers checking that the UI looks natural on different screens.</li>
          <li>Designers making sure lighting and shadows look realistic in a demo app.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p><strong>GPU Real Example:</strong> RT cores calculate realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in 3D graphics and architecture models.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Step 3: How They Work Together</h2>
      <p>Imagine the PM (CPU) gives a new project to the team:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Developers (CUDA cores)</strong> build the main product quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Engineers (Tensor cores)</strong> add smart features like chatbots or recommendations.</li>
        <li><strong>Testers/Designers (RT cores)</strong> make sure the product looks great and works smoothly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, the project is delivered faster and with better quality â€” just like how CUDA, Tensor, and RT cores in a GPU work together to render stunning games, run AI, and simulate real-world visuals.</p>
    </div>

      <p>ðŸ’¡ Tip: Think of the CPU as the planner and the GPU as the doer. The more specialized cores in the GPU, the more powerful and efficient the work becomes!</p>
